# EDA-Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-
I analyzed hotel booking cancellations using Python tools like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The focus was on understanding what causes cancellationsâ€”like booking timing, room type, customer details, and how bookings are made. I looked into whether higher prices, longer wait times, or booking through certain channels affect cancellations. The findings helped suggest ways hotels can improve booking policies, make customers happier, and boost profits with better pricing and promotions.
